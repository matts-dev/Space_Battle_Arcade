ANY OTHER MODELS ARE NOT OWNED BY ME AND WERE MISSED WHEN REMOVING TUTORIAL CODE.

Other models (from tutorial code used in reference code) may be from these locations.
AFAIK I have removed all references from these models when starting this project (which duplicated my learning project)
So I believe these sources are no longer necessary
